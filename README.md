## About

- AutoDesk 3ds Max, often referred to simply as 3ds Max, is a professional 3D computer graphics program used for making 3D animations, models, games, and images. Developed and produced by Autodesk Media and Entertainment, it is widely used in various industries, including film, television, video games, and architecture. Here is a more detailed look at 3ds Max:

-Key Features

-1. Modeling:

-Polygon Modeling: Create complex models using vertices, edges, and faces.
-Spline/Curve Modeling: Allows for detailed and precise control over shapes and surfaces.
-NURBS: Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines for creating smooth and complex surfaces.

-2. Animation:

-Keyframe Animation: Animate objects, characters, and cameras with precision.
-Rigging and Skinning: Tools for creating skeletons (rigs) and binding them to character meshes (skinning).
-Motion Paths: Visual representation of an object's movement in the scene.
